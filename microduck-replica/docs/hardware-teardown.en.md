# Microduck Electronics, Reverse-Engineered

> ⚠️ **This English version lags behind the Chinese original.** Several corrections (camera rotation, MK1 part number, U10 placement, STS3032 torque basis, board SKU) were applied to the Chinese docs first. **When the two disagree, the Chinese version wins.** Last sync: 2026-09-05.

**Method:** the Rust runtime is open source, and a runtime that drives real hardware has
to hard-code device paths, I²C addresses, register offsets, baud rates and protocols.
**The code is the datasheet.** Everything below comes from the source, device trees and
config files in the `pollen-robotics/microduck` repository.

**The central design idea: one Dynamixel bus does everything.** The IMU is not on I²C —
it is built as a Dynamixel slave sitting on the servo bus, and is read in the **same
`sync_read` transaction** as the servos. Pack voltage needs no fuel gauge either: the
firmware simply reads what the servos report as their own supply.

## 2. Main Board: Radxa Zero 3W

| Item | Value | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SoC | **RK3566** | `compatible = "radxa,zero-3w", "rockchip,rk3566"` |
| Form factor | Pi Zero, 65×30 mm, 40-pin header | matches the size of `pcb__raspberry_pi_zero_2_w.stl` |
| OS | **Armbian** (Debian-based), vendor kernel 6.1.115 | `armbianEnv.txt`, overlay comments |
| Servo serial port | **`/dev/ttyS2`** | `deploy/robotd.toml` |
| NPU | **0.8 TOPS / INT8 / single core**, node `npu@fde40000`, **disabled by default in Armbian** | `npu-bringup.md`; overlay + `setup-npu.sh` + reboot, see [§7b](#7b-the-npu-and-on-board-vision) |
| Policy inference | ONNX Runtime ≥1.23 (installs 1.28.0), loaded with `dlopen` | `Cargo.toml` workspace metadata |
| NPU inference | rknn-toolkit2 runtime | same |

> 💡 **The single most important finding:** the main board is not a custom carrier.
> It is an **off-the-shelf Radxa Zero 3W**. An earlier version of this document claimed
> "the RK3566 carrier is custom and unobtainable" — that was wrong. It is a stock module.

## 3. `imu_to_dxl` v2 — the one board you must build

**The most elegant piece of the design, and the easiest one to reproduce.**

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| IMU chip | **LSM6DSV16X** (ST 6-axis, with the SFLP on-chip sensor-fusion block) |
| Interface | **Dynamixel bus** — *not* I²C |
| Bus ID | **200** |
| Register address | **124** |
| Read by control loop | 12 bytes |
| Full diagnostic block | 20 bytes (also raw accelerometer, sample counter, status flags) |

### The 12-byte block

| Bytes | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0..6` | gyro x/y/z, `i16` little-endian raw counts, range **±500 dps**, **17.5 mdps/LSB** |
| `6..12` | SFLP quaternion x/y/z as **IEEE half-precision (fp16)**; `w = √(1 − x² − y² − z²)` |

### Why it is built this way

1. **No extra bus** — it comes back in the same `sync_read` as the 15 servos, at zero
   additional cost.
2. **No host-side fusion** — the LSM6DSV16X's SFLP block emits a game-rotation quaternion
   on-chip and estimates its own gyro bias.
3. **Only three quaternion components are sent** — a unit quaternion lets `w` be
   reconstructed, saving a byte pair so the whole thing fits in one transaction.

### What it takes to build one

- LSM6DSV16X (or a pin-compatible ST 6-axis part)
- A small MCU acting as a Dynamixel Protocol V2 slave (an STM32G0 or CH32V is plenty)
- A half-duplex TTL transceiver (the Dynamixel bus is single-wire half-duplex)
- Power taken from the bus

**This is the board most worth designing yourself in the whole project** — few components,
clear logic, and the protocol is fully documented above.

## 4. Pollen RPI Robot HAT — **already published; do not redraw it**

> 📌 **Correction (2026-09-03)**: this section previously treated the board as unpublished and
> in need of reverse engineering. **That was wrong.** The board is fully open at
> [`pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT)
> (**Apache-2.0**): KiCad 9 schematic and PCB, Gerbers, BOM, pick-and-place, STEP, plus every
> datasheet. The earlier search covered only the `microduck` repository and missed the
> organisation's `elec_`-prefixed hardware repositories.

**Download the official Gerbers and order the board. This section is kept as a
reverse-engineering-versus-reality record.**

### ⚠️ Four things to know before you order it

**1. There is no charging circuit and no USB-C input on this board.**

The repository contains a `pwr_supply_charge.kicad_sch`, which makes it easy to assume the board
charges the battery. **It is an orphan sheet** — `main.kicad_sch` instantiates only
`audio / dynamixel / power / sensors`, never it, and its title block still reads
`Chromapi's Power Supply & Charge`, a leftover from another project.

Checked against the production BOM: `CN3302` (Li-ion charger), `HY2120` (protection), the USB-C
receptacle, the power switch, the indicator LEDs, `AO4435`/`FDS6630A` — **none of them are on it.**

Only two power parts are actually fitted:

| Ref | Part | Function |
|---|---|---|
| `U10` | **LM5050-1** | Ideal-diode controller (reverse protection / OR-ing) |
| `U9` | **AP63205** | Buck converter |

> **The battery must be charged with an external charger.** Plugging in USB-C will not charge the robot.

**2. Opening the KiCad project needs a second repository.**

The HAT repository has **no** `sym-lib-table`, no `fp-lib-table` and no `.pretty` directory, yet the
schematic references `Library_Pollen`, `LCSC_parts_lib` and `Lib_Pollen`. Those live in
[`pollen-robotics/lib_KiCAD`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/lib_KiCAD).

Without it the project opens as a field of unresolved symbols.
**Not needed if you only want to fabricate** — use the Gerbers in `production/` directly.

**3. Four layers, 118 placements, assembly service required.**

The `kicad_pcb` layer stack is `F.Cu / In1.Cu / In2.Cu / B.Cu`. The BOM is 47 lines and 123 parts,
including a **VQFN-32 codec** and an **LGA-16 BMI088** — hand soldering is not realistic; order it
with SMT assembly.

Five DNP lines: `C25`, `R10/R11`, `R16/R17/R41`, `R36/R37`, and **`U4`**.

**4. `U4 = CAT24C32` is DNP → this is not a self-identifying HAT.**

The EEPROM position is left empty, so the board does not follow the `hat-plus-specification`
auto-detection flow. The device-tree overlay has to be applied by hand.

### Also: the Dynamixel side is dual-standard

| Ref | Interface | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `J13 / J14` | **TTL 3P** (JST EH 2.5 mm) | Microduck's XL330 servos use this |
| `J3 / J11` | **RS-485 4P** (JST EH 2.5 mm) | driven by `U8 = SIT3088E` |
| `TH1` | 100R thermistor | overcurrent protection |

So the board drives **both TTL and RS-485 Dynamixels, and Feetech servos**, with a cable change.

### Also: this is not a Microduck-only board

It is a general-purpose HAT for small and medium robots. Three known users:

- **Microduck** (this project)
- Pollen's own **Grabette / Casquette** (running on a Pi 4)
- Third-party **[`Rhoban/microban`](https://github.com/Rhoban/microban)** — a 19×XL330 + Pi Zero 2W
  + 2×18650 biped with a **complete public BOM, assembly and printing guide** (~$567 total).
  Worth cross-checking when sourcing parts.

> One line from `Rhoban/microban`'s BOM is worth remembering:
> *"Unlike the other components, the RPI Robot Hat is not an off-the-shelf part: it is an
> open-source board that you need to have manufactured."*
> — **open source ≠ purchasable.** You still have to fabricate it.

### Reverse-engineered conclusions checked against the official BOM

| Derived here | Actual official BOM | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Audio codec @ `0x18` | `U2 = TLV320AIC3104IRHBR` | ✅ |
| BMI088 @ `0x19/0x68`, fitted but unused | `U11 = BMI088` | ✅ |
| Pull-ups "a single 10k pair, **R12/R13**" | `R12, R13 = 10k` | ✅ **exact designators** |
| "Stemma **J5** connector" | `J5–J8 = JST SH 1 mm 4P` | ✅ |
| Pi Zero 40-pin form factor | `J4 = 2x20 rasp HAT zero SMD` | ✅ |

### What the source code could **not** reveal

| Part | Function |
|---|---|
| `U1 = PAM8406D` | Class-D audio amplifier |
| `MK1` | **On-board MEMS microphone** (LCSC `C7587901`). ⚠️ The official BOM only says `Microphone_MEMS`; the part number LMA2718 had no source and has been withdrawn |
| `U10 = LM5050-1` | Ideal-diode controller (reverse protection / OR-ing) |
| `AP63205` | Buck converter |
| `CAT24C32` | EEPROM — required by the Raspberry Pi HAT+ specification |
| `J1/J2/J9 = Wago-2` | Screwless terminals: external speaker and second microphone |
| `J3/J11`, `J13/J14` | Dynamixel 4P / 3P connectors (JST EH 2.5 mm) |

Two more facts from the official README that the source code does not carry:

- **Input range 5–28 V**, designed to be **powered through the motor connector**
- Dynamixel **TTL and RS485 both supported** (cable change only; drives Feetech servos too)

### What is on it

| Part | I²C address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **TLV320AIC3104** | `0x18` | TI audio codec, I²S data + I²C control |
| **BMI088** | `0x19` / `0x68` | **Actually fitted, but unused by software** (BOM `U11`; the comments say "dormant", "unused but still connected"). This is the second of the "two IMUs" the press mentions |
| **ToF** | `0x29` or `0x52` | Not on the board; via the **Stemma/Qwiic J5** header. The firmware supports **both VL53L5CX and VL53L8CX**, identified by revision ID |

- I²C bus: header **pins 3 and 5** (`GPIO1_A0` = SDA, `GPIO1_A1` = SCL)
- Bus speed **400 kHz** — capped by the codec and the BMI088; the VL53L5CX alone would
  take 1 MHz
- Pull-ups: **a single 10 kΩ pair, R12/R13**
- Audio clocks: **12 MHz** fixed MCLK, I²S system clock **12.288 MHz** (256 × 48 kHz)
- **The robot's internal power runs through this board** (battery → HAT → main board)

### ⚠️ A trap they hit themselves, documented in the overlay

The RK3566's `i2c3` controller runs in its **M1 pin mux** in the vendor DTB
(`GPIO3_B5/B6`, next to the USB-C port), where it serves the **FUSB302 USB-C PD
controller**. The pins the HAT needs — 3 and 5 — are that same controller's **M0 pin mux**.

Their overlay re-muxes the controller to M0 and disables the fusb302 node. Consequences:

- **USB-C PD negotiation is lost**
- But the FUSB302's power-on defaults already present Rd on both CC lines
  (`SWITCHES0 = PDWN1|PDWN2`), so USB-C chargers — PD or dumb — **still deliver 5 V**,
  and the board only ever wanted 5 V
- In-robot power comes from the battery through the HAT regardless
- maskrom flashing is ROM code and is unaffected

> An earlier revision used **bit-banged I²C** (`i2c-gpio-pihat`), which burned CPU in
> `udelay()` busy-waits. Moving to the hardware controller is what made the
> **15 Hz ToF stream** affordable. The two modes are mutually exclusive; `install.sh`
> selects between them with `MICRODUCK_I2C_MODE=hw|bitbang`.

### Stable device node

`/dev/i2c-3` is symlinked to **`/dev/i2c-pihat`** by a udev rule, so consumer code works
unchanged in either mode.

## 5. The Servo Bus

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Motors | **Dynamixel XL330 × 15** |
| Protocol | **Dynamixel Protocol V2** |
| Baud rate | **1 Mbps** (EEPROM register `baud_rate = 3`) |
| Serial port | `/dev/ttyS2` |
| Rust crate | [`rustypot`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/rustypot) — Pollen's own |
| Control loop | **50 Hz** |

### ID assignment

```
Left leg    20  21  22  23  24    hip_yaw / hip_roll / hip_pitch / knee / ankle
Neck+head   30  31  32  33  34    neck_pitch / head_pitch / head_yaw / head_roll / mouth
Right leg   10  11  12  13  14    (mirror of the left)
IMU board   200                   imu_to_dxl v2
```

> **The 15th servo is the mouth (ID 34, index 9).** Every alpha policy is
> `obs[1,61] → actions[1,14]`, and the action vector **skips that index** — the mouth is

>
> This ID scheme is **identical to Open Duck Mini v2** (20-24 / 30-33 / 10-14), with only
> the extra 34 added. The lineage shows.

## 5b. Communications, Item by Item

### Main bus: single-wire half-duplex TTL UART — **not RS-232, not RS-485**

| Item | Value | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Physical layer | **3-wire TTL half-duplex** (data + VDD + GND) | XL330 spec: 3-pin JST, TTL |
| Logic level | **3.3 V** | RK3566 IO level |
| Protocol | **Dynamixel Protocol V2** | `.with_protocol_v2()` |
| Rate | **1 Mbps** | `BAUD_RATE = 1_000_000`, EEPROM `baud_rate = 3` |
| Port | `/dev/ttyS2` = RK3566 **UART2, M0 pin mux** | `robotd.toml`, `uart2-m0` overlay |
| Devices on the bus | **16**: 15 servos + 1 IMU board | `ids = [200, 20..24, 30..34, 10..14]` |
| Per transaction | one `sync_read` covering all 16 devices, registers **124–136** | `bus.rs` |

> ❗ **It is not RS-485.** RS-485 is a differential pair, used by Dynamixel's XM/XH series
> (4-pin). The XL330 is **single-wire half-duplex TTL** (3-pin). Searching the whole
> repository for `rs485|rs232|half-duplex|direction pin` returns **zero hits** — there is
> no direction-control GPIO in the code, which means **direction switching is done in
> hardware by a self-steering circuit**, and that circuit lives on the HAT.

### ⚠️ The Armbian trap: UART2 has a login console on it by default

> From `robotd-design.md`: Armbian runs `serial-getty@ttyS2` by default, and `agetty` holds
> the port. You must `systemctl mask serial-getty@ttyS2`. Pollen found this with
> `fuser -v /dev/ttyS2` naming `agetty`.

### Every interface at a glance

| Interface | Used for | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| **UART2 (`ttyS2`)** | servos + IMU board | 1 Mbps, TTL half-duplex |
| **I2C3 (M0, pins 3/5)** | audio codec / ToF / (the unused BMI088) | 400 kHz |
| **I2S3 (`i2s3_2ch`)** | audio data | MCLK 12 MHz, sysclk 12.288 MHz |
| **MIPI CSI** | IMX219 camera | I²C control at `0x10` |
| **Bluetooth** | gamepad (`padd`), phone app (`btd`) | on-module |
| **Wi-Fi** | WebRTC video, provisioning (`configd`) | on-module |
| **USB-C** | power + maskrom flashing | PD negotiation sacrificed by the overlay |
| **Unix sockets** | JSON-RPC between daemons | not hardware |

---

## 5c. Why This Needs a Linux SoC and Not an STM32 or ESP32

The main board has to do all of this at once:

| Task | Load |
|---|---|
| ONNX Runtime policy inference | `obs[1,61] → act[1,14]` @ **50 Hz** |
| WebRTC video | 720p30 H.264, **Rockchip MPP hardware encoder** |
| RKNN NPU object detection | `duck_detect.rknn` @ 2 Hz — a **thermal limit**, 95 °C flat out |
| GStreamer pipeline + congestion control | `rtpgccbwe` costs 7.6 % of a core |
| Bluetooth gamepad + phone app + Wi-Fi | BlueZ stack |
| Signed firmware update / rollback | `updaterd` |

**An MCU cannot do this.** WebRTC plus H.264 hardware encoding plus ONNX inference alone
requires Linux, a hardware encoder and an NPU.

Hence the choice: **RK3566, quad Cortex-A55 + Mali-G52 + NPU, running Armbian**.

> 📌 Note, though, that **the prototype ran on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**. From
> `robotd.toml`: the 50 Hz control loop *"is inherited from the prototype, where it was
> chosen on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. It has never been re-derived on the Radxa."*
> Open Duck Mini v2 still runs on a Pi Zero 2W today — because it does no vision and no
> WebRTC.

### So what MCU is on the `imu_to_dxl` board?

**Not in the repository** — that is the board's own firmware, which is not open source.
But its job defines the requirements:

- Act as a **Dynamixel Protocol V2 slave** (answer `sync_read`, ID 200, register 124)
- Read the **LSM6DSV16X** (SPI or I²C)
- Sustain **1 Mbps UART** with half-duplex direction switching
- Pack the SFLP quaternion into fp16

**An STM32G0, STM32G4, CH32V203 or ESP32 are all sufficient.** This is exactly the place
where you are free to choose — as long as it behaves like a Dynamixel slave on the wire,
the host does not care what is inside.

## 6. Power and Battery

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Battery | **Sony NP-F550** (L-series camcorder pack), **2S Li-ion** |

> ⚠️ **It is an NP-F550, not an F970.** The upstream mesh is named `np_f970`, but its bounding box
> measures **70.8 × 38.6 × 20.6 mm** — NP-F550/F570 size — and the source only ever names the F550.
> A real NP-F970 is ~60 mm thick and ~300 g: **it does not fit and blows the weight budget.**
> See [BOM](../BOM.en.md).
| Nominal | 7.2 V |
| Full, under load | **8.2 V** |
| Empty, under load | **6.6 V** |
| Fuel gauge | **none** |
| ADC | **none** |

### How the voltage is measured

> From the source: *"There is no fuel gauge and no ADC. The only measurement available is
> what the servos report as their own supply."*

The pack voltage is read **over the Dynamixel protocol, from what the servos report as
their own supply** — the battery as seen through the bus. That means the reading **sags
under load and recovers at rest**, so the 6.6–8.2 V span is a **usable-under-load range**,
not the cells' chemical range.

When the battery EMA (about a 10-second time constant) reaches 6.6 V, the robot
**sits down gracefully and powers off**.

> Good news for anyone reproducing this: **you do not need any battery-monitoring circuit
> at all.**

---

## 7. Sensors

### ToF depth

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Chip | **VL53L5CX** or **VL53L8CX** (ST multizone ranger; two generations, one interface) |
| Address | `0x29` |
| Bus | the HAT's i2c3 |
| Frame rate | 15 Hz |

Used for the `theremin` feature: the distance of a hand in front of the beak maps to a
pitch, and the mouth opens with it. Playable band 0.10–0.70 m.

### Camera

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Sensor | **IMX219** (= Raspberry Pi Camera v2) |
| I²C address | `0x10` |
| Device-tree overlay | `radxa-zero3-rpi-camera-v2` |
| Mounting | **a quarter turn off** — `mediad/src/main.rs:82` defaults `--rotate` to **90**.<br>⚠️ The 180° in `docs/project/media-bringup.md:472` is **alpha-unit** data. |
| Sensor mode | pinned to 1920×1080@30 (its boot mode caps capture at 21 fps) |
| Default output | 720p30, 2 Mb/s |
| Encoding | GStreamer + **Rockchip MPP hardware encoder** → WebRTC |
| HFOV | ~62° |

### Audio

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Codec | TLV320AIC3104 |
| ALSA card name | `aic3104` |
| Microphone | on **Mic3R** (mono, right PGA); every other input is switched off |
| Output | line out, volume 9/9 |

## 7b. The NPU and On-Board Vision

> Compiled from upstream `docs/project/npu-bringup.md` and `duck-detect/`.
> It is currently the only material that states plainly what the RK3566's NPU can actually do.

### NPU specification

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Compute | **0.8 TOPS, INT8, single core** | opening of `npu-bringup.md` |
| Device-tree node | `npu@fde40000` | Armbian ships it `status = "disabled"` |
| Runtime | rknn-toolkit2 runtime, `librknnrt.so` | driver 0.9.8 / runtime 2.3.2 (measured) |

### ⚠️ Two hard constraints that will stop a replica dead

**1. The driver exists only in the vendor kernel. Mainline has none.**

> Upstream: *"The driver is the gate: it is part of the vendor kernel, mainline has none,
> and nothing in userspace can work around its absence."*

This is far more serious than "the NPU is off by default". Swap in a mainline-kernel distro —
which most official Debian/Ubuntu images are — and **the NPU simply is not there, with no
userspace workaround**. The OS image is not a free choice when reproducing this robot.

**2. Armbian disables the NPU node on every Radxa Zero 3.**

So a stock board has the hardware, the kernel and the driver, and still **no NPU**.

```bash
# Upstream runs this from the preinstall hook on every robotctl update, non-fatally
sudo sh /opt/robot/daemon/current/scripts/setup-npu.sh
# writes the overlay -> reboot required -> confirm with:
dmesg | grep rknpu
```

Run the copy **inside the release**, not `/usr/local/sbin/robot-setup-npu`: the overlay source
lives beside the script, and the standalone copy has nothing beside it on a first run.

### The duck detector

The model is trained in a separate repository, `pollen-robotics/duck_detector`, and arrives here
already quantised as `.rknn`.

> ⚠️ **That repository is not public** (404 as of 2026-09-04). Upstream docs reference it, but the
> training code is not obtainable — only the finished `.rknn`. Training your own means building a
> YOLO pipeline from scratch.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Network | `yolo11n` @ **320×320** |
| Classes | **1** (the duck) |
| Training set | **150 frames from 3 sessions** |
| mAP50 | **0.976** on a held-out session |
| Size after INT8 quantisation | **3.9 MB** |
| Quantisation loss | 2 of 2 detections kept at 95% box overlap vs the float model, on the desk |

> 0.976 from 150 frames — single class, fixed subject, constrained scene. That data
> requirement is good news for anyone reproducing this.

### Measured performance (Radxa Zero 3, paced 2 Hz, 30 frames over 3 passes)

| Item | Measured | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Latency p50 / p95 | **25.7 ms / 58.4 ms** | inference plus decode, not JPEG decoding |
| CPU per frame | 20.7 ms | **not the NPU's cost** — see below |
| SoC temperature | **63 °C** | at the end of a paced run |

**That CPU figure invites misreading.** The latency column times `infer` + `decode`; the CPU
column is the whole loop's process CPU divided by frames, so it **also carries `letterbox_rgb`**
— a 1280×720 → 320×320 resample that runs on the CPU and is not in the latency column at all.
Whether the remainder means `rknn_run` busy-waits (charging NPU wait to the CPU) is not yet known
upstream either.

For why the rate is 2 Hz, see [§8, Two engineering details worth stealing](#two-engineering-details-worth-stealing)
— it is a **thermal limit, not a preference**; running flat out reaches 95 °C.

### Three engineering decisions worth stealing

**1. `dlopen`, not link.** `librknnrt.so` is a vendor blob in no Debian suite, and a crate that
linked it could not be cross-compiled in CI. The cost is `duck-detect/src/rknn.rs`; the benefit is
that `cargo board --bins` still works on a laptop. `robotd` reaches ONNX Runtime the same way.

**2. Let the runtime dequantise.** A quantised model's output tensor is int8 with a scale and a
zero point. `rknn_outputs_get` will convert to float if asked, and upstream asks — the alternative
is carrying the scale into the decoder and **getting it wrong once, quietly**.

**3. Triage in the order that matters: does it run → does it still see → what does it cost.**
`duck-bench` reports in exactly that order. A model that runs and detects nothing looks exactly
like one that works.

> ⚠️ **A quantised model's scores are on their own scale.** The float model's 0.5 is not this
> model's 0.5. When it detects nothing, try `--threshold 0.2` before believing the conversion
> is broken.

### What is still missing

**Nothing on the robot can get a frame.** `mediad` has a raw NV12 tee branch that exists precisely
for this, but **no IPC exposes it** — which is also why capturing a dataset has to stop `mediad`
to take the camera.

Upstream names two ways forward, not exclusive: add a `media.frame` call that answers with one
frame; or put the detector inside `mediad`, subscribing to the raw branch, running at a few Hz and
publishing detections on the state stream.

> The second is where it ends up: **perception next to the sensor, deriving features rather than
> shipping pixels.**

### What this means if you are reproducing it

1. **The OS image is not a free choice** — it must carry the Rockchip vendor kernel (Armbian family)
2. First thing after you get a board: **enable the NPU node and reboot**, or every inference runs on the CPU
3. Training your own model starts at roughly **150 frames** for usable accuracy — a lower bar than expected
4. Do not plan on pulling frames off the robot for your own work yet — **upstream has not finished that path**

## 8. Software Parameters You Must Match

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Control loop | **50 Hz** | inherited from the Pi Zero 2W prototype; **never re-derived on the Radxa** |
| Policy interface | `obs[1,61] → actions[1,14]` | checked at load; the older 51-D family is refused |
| `action_scale` | 0.9 (walk) / 0.8 (roller) | |
| Position P gain | **200** | ×0.8 while standing |
| Action low-pass | head **0.5** / legs **0.7** | **must match training**, or transfer degrades |
| Voltage adaptation | off by default | when on: `scale × (7.4 / measured EMA)`, clamped 6.0–9.5 V |

### Two engineering details worth stealing

**1. Predictive soft landing (`limp_fall`)**

It does not wait for the fall. Projected gravity rotates with the trunk, so its rate of
change is exactly `-(ω × g)` — and the gyro in that same 12-byte IMU block is used to
extrapolate **300 ms** ahead. When the robot is **already** tilted past about 26°,
**is still tipping rather than recovering**, and the extrapolation lands past the
threshold, the gain drops from 200 to **50** so the joints give way instead of fighting
the floor, and the robot **arrives limp**. Once it has gone still — judged from the gyro,
not a timer — the pose is ramped back to standing over 600 ms, and only then handed back
to the standing policy.

> The rationale in the source is worth quoting: the standing policy is *"a good
> stand-up-er and a bad faller"*. From a still robot, face down or face up, it gets back
> on its feet cleanly; out of a dynamic fall it tries and fails and tries again, at
> walking gain, against the floor — and the motors pay for every attempt.

**2. The 2 Hz detection rate is a thermal limit**

> From the source: *"2 is a thermal limit, not a preference."* Flat out it reaches
> **95 °C** and the CPU throttles to **408 MHz** — a robot that walks badly in order to
> see well.

## 9. What It Takes to Reproduce This Electronics Stack

### ✅ Buy off the shelf

| Part | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Main board | **Radxa Zero 3W** | stock module, **not custom** |
| Servos | Dynamixel XL330 × 15 | |
| Battery | **Sony NP-F550** + holder | common camcorder pack. **Not the F970 — it does not fit** |
| Camera | Raspberry Pi Camera v2 (IMX219) | |
| ToF | VL53L8CX module (Stemma/Qwiic) | |

### 📥 One board you simply download

**RPI Robot HAT — do not draw it.**
[`pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT`](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/elec_RPI_Robot_HAT)
(Apache-2.0) ships a `production/` folder with Gerbers, BOM and pick-and-place. Order it as is.
Note it is a **4-layer** board.

If you want to simplify (no microphone, no speaker), you can also skip it entirely: put a stock
VL53L8CX module straight onto i2c3 and use an off-the-shelf 5 V UBEC for power.

### 🔧 The one board you must build yourself

**`imu_to_dxl`** — no public project exists anywhere, so this is the only board that has to be
rebuilt from scratch. LSM6DSV16X + a small MCU (Dynamixel V2 slave) + a half-duplex TTL
transceiver. The protocol and 12-byte register layout are given in full above; implement to that.

### ⚠️ Traps to plan for

1. **i2c3 collides with the FUSB302** — using the hardware I²C on pins 3/5 costs USB-C PD
   negotiation (plain 5 V charging still works). See section 4.
2. **The NPU ships disabled** — Armbian does not enable it; flash the overlay and reboot
   before running RKNN models.
3. **The camera is mounted a quarter turn off** — set `rotate=90` and let the hardware encoder
   do it; do *not* use `videoflip`, which is a full CPU pass over every frame.
4. **The 50 Hz loop was never validated on the Radxa** — Pollen say so themselves; the
   number came from the Pi Zero 2W prototype.

## 10. Conclusion: This Electronics Stack Can Be Reproduced

An earlier version of this document concluded "the RK3566 carrier is custom and
unobtainable, the PCB is a hard wall." **That conclusion was wrong:**

- The main board is an **off-the-shelf Radxa Zero 3W**, not a custom carrier
- Of the two custom boards, `imu_to_dxl` has very few components and its protocol is now
  fully recovered — it is straightforward to build
- **The HAT board is fully published by Pollen** (KiCad + Gerbers + BOM) — no need to draw it

**What actually remains is software.** The Rust runtime is open source (Apache-2.0) but
bound to the Radxa Zero 3W's specific wiring — so if you build around the same main board,
**the runtime runs as-is.**
